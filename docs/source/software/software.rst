Software
========

The software is based on the open source `ArduPilot <https://ardupilot.org>`_. This amazing project allows to control rovers, copters, planes and more awkward configurations like this tricopter. Version 4.0.7 is used (but, a priori, the latest version could be used. I did not have time to test it).
