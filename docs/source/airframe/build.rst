Structure
=========

Configuration
-------------

The chosen aircraft configuration is a tilt-rotor quadplane.
It is based on a 1.8m span RC glider modified to receive three motors.
The two front motors are placed on two arms fixed perpendicularly to the wings.
A rearward motor is fixed on the fuselage in front of the rudder.
The front motors can tilt around the pitch axis in order to ensure both hovering and conventional flight.

Board mounting
--------------

The UDB5 board is mounted upside down. It is complemented with a magnetometer which is mounted upside down below the wing.
