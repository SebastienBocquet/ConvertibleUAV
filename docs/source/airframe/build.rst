Configuration
-------------

The chosen aircraft configuration is a tilt-rotor quadplane.
It is based on a 1.8m span RC glider modified to receive three motors.
The two front motors are placed on two arms fixed perpendicularly to the wings.
A rearward motor is fixed on the fuselage in front of the rudder.
The front motors can tilt around the pitch axis in order to ensure both hovering and conventional flight.
